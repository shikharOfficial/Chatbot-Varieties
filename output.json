            "Aurigo Engage is a software as a service (SaaS) based product that enables infrastructure and construction agencies to efficiently collaborate with general public potentially using a proposed infrastructure. Aurigo Engage is a reliable full-featured web-based solution to determine general public sentiments on proposed projects. It is designed to collate and analyze general public feedback on potential projects early in the capital planning process. Aurigo Engage uses robust artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform powerful analysis on the collated feedback and provides critical insights into user sentiment so agencies can decide on the best approach to the proposed project.",
            "Aurigo\nEngage involves the following phases:",
            "Aurigo Engage enables agencies to easily create and effectively promote campaigns for proposed capital projects, solicit feedback from potential users of the infrastructure, analyze feedback, acknowledge, and respond to feedback. Aurigo Engage enables general public to view details of proposed projects in campaigns and voice their opinions on the projects.",
            "Once a campaign with information on the proposed project is created, infrastructure and construction agencies can broadcast and promote these campaigns using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media to solicit feedback. Aurigo Engage then performs powerful sentimental analysis on the feedback received and presents analyzed information efficiently. Based on these effective illustrations of general public sentiment that Aurigo Engage provides, agencies can now make informed decisions on proposed projects."
